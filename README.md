## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process

1. **Data Loading:** Load the sales data into the chosen data analysis tool (e.g., Excel, SQL Server).
   
2. **Data Cleaning:** 
   - Handle missing values.
   - Clean and format data for analysis.
   - Detectdatatype
   - Remove duplicate entries.
   
3. **Data Exploration:**
   - Explore the distribution of sales by month to identify trends.
   - Analyze weekly sales distribution by weekday to understand customer behavior.
  


   
## Metrics

The metrics included in the analysis are revenue, sales quantity, and profit margin. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of sales performance and profitability.




## Analysis Insights

- **Sales by Month:** Analysis shows sales trends over the months, highlighting peak sales periods and seasonal variations.
- **Weekly Sales Distribution by Weekday:** Examining sales patterns by weekday provides insights into customer behavior and preferences.
- **Top 5 Best Selling Products:** Identifying the best-selling products helps focus marketing and inventory strategies.
- **Top 5 Products by Sales Count:** Understanding which products have the highest sales count can guide product development and promotions.
- **Top 5 Cities by State:** Analyzing sales performance across cities helps identify key markets for targeted efforts.



## Conclusions

- Splitting the `Order Date` column into `Time` and `Date` and extracting the month name as a new column adds granularity to the analysis.
- Removal of the `Month` column and extraction of the month name as a new column enables more efficient and intuitive analysis of sales trends.
- Extracting the day name column enhances analysis by providing additional context and allowing for deeper exploration of sales patterns.
